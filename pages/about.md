# **About Me**

Hi, I am **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:,<br> A Ph.D. student at Radboud University working on adversarial machine learning, mostly in backdoor attacks and federated learning. Apart from my research, I am very passionate about science in general and, in particular, astronomy. Related to this, and as a side project, I am developing an autonomous telescope that can take pictures of the sky and track stellar objects by reusing old stepper motors from a 3D printer and a raspberry pi. You can track its progress in my <a href="https://github.com/GorkaAbad/Telescope">GitHub</a>.
